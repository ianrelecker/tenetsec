AI Engine Architecture

Security Assessment Results -> Data Anonymization Engine -> Prompt Engineering & API Integration -> Actionable Security Recommendations

The AI recommendation engine consists of four main components:

1. Security Assessment Results: The output from all security assessment modules
2. Data Anonymization Engine: Scrubs sensitive tenant information from assessment results
3. Prompt Engineering & API Integration: Creates structured prompts and handles API communication with external AI services
4. External AI API: Provides advanced language processing capabilities (OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, etc.)
5. Actionable Security Recommendations: Prioritized, detailed security recommendations with implementation steps

Data flow:
- Raw security assessment results are first processed by the anonymization engine
- Anonymized data is formatted into prompts and sent to external AI API
- AI responses are parsed and formatted into structured recommendations
- Recommendations are integrated into the security report
